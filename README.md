# Machine Learning Projects

This repository is a personal learning journey in Machine Learning, inspired by the work and ideas of [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai/). Each project is a hands-on exploration of foundational concepts, focusing on implementing solutions from scratch to deepen my understanding and refine my skills.
